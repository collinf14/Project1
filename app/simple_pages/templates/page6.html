                </p>
                <p>
                    Arrange is the first thing one needs to do when starting to test. It is the set-up for how
                    everything on the testing page should be laid out. It is key that this step is done properly as the
                    rest of the test will be very confusing to follow if it is not arranged properly. As can be seen in
                    the example above from the test calculator add method of this calculator, the Arranging begins at the
                    top. The tuple_to_list variable is created first to set up its later use in the test. If a thing wasn't
                    arranged properly and the variable was created later on then anything before the instantiation of that variable
                    would not be able to use it at all. This would render the test cases before it invalid in the case of this
                    calculator. A variable can be
                    done inside or like this example outside the test. This calculator does it outside because this variable will
                    be used for all the tests in this file and therefore needs to be global and not only in one test.
                    The next step is then to act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="boldunder">Act</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The performing of an action is the next step within the testing process. This action is normally
                    using one of the methods that one has working on the file that is being tested. Since the test is to check out
                    that method, properly putting the method into action is vital. This action is done to sent up an
                    expected result that one can gain validity of the test from. In the above example, the act step is done by
                    setting a variable called result (our expected result) to use the function the test is checking, in
                    this case Calculator.add, with the variable set in the Arrange step. Once this action has been completed
                    its on to the checking stage.

                <p>
                    <span class="boldunder">Assert</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The assertion step is doing the actually checking for an expected outcome. The assert will tell a user
                    if the test was positive (true) or negative (false). A test needs an assert step in order to
                    really do the test. It is actually technically the only line it needs since the action step can be
                    inserted within the assertion. In the example above, the assertion is done by checking that the result
                    of the action is actually true. The expected result of the addition of the values 1 and 2 put forth
                    in the arrange step is 3 (1 + 2 = 3). After this step the test is complete and can be checked with
                    pytest in a command terminal.

                    Why is AAA Testing important?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Test are the groundwork in which a programmer uses to check that their code is working properly.
                    In this calculator, there is a variety of test used to check everything from the addition add
                    function to the keeping of history of operations. AAA testing is key in this calculator because it
                    valid how the calculator. Without a check on every operation within the calculator there is no way
                    to prove that the calculation actually subtracts 1 from 2 and gets on or adds that calculation to
                    the history of calculations so that a user can go back in and check that the calculator has done that
                    calculation, and it is working properly.
