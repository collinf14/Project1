                fully while editing the source code. CI/CD allows for testing and experimentation as a developer is
                going through the process of a building a project. It is also used to get apps to consumers as quickly
                as possible and allow for changes based on the consumers wants and needs as it is seen fit.</p>

                    Arrange is the first thing one needs to do when starting to test. It is the set up for how
                    everything on the testing page should be laid out.

                    The performing of an action is the next step within the testing process. This action is normally
                    using one of the methods that you have working on the file you are testing. In this action, there
                    is an expected result.
