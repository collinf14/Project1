            <p class="lead my-3"> SOLID is can be described as the roadway in which OOP drives down. It sets up the
                signs and directions
                for OOP through the 5 key principles. The principles are made so that every programmer has similar
                styling
                information can easier be understood between two programmer.
                These principles are the backbone on which this calculator project was
                built.</p>

                    The Single-Responsibility Principle
                </h5>
                <p>
                    This principle states that a class should only have to do a single thing. This is for
                    simplicity and usability, a class that does more than one thing may get confusing to use and
                    even more difficult to test. This principle is shown in different parts of the calculator. The
                    calculation only do their said calculation. While the Division calculation does division and a
                    check for dividing by zero, the only real act it takes is the dividing of 2 numbers. This principle
                    carries over into the test. There is not one test that check addition and subtraction because
                    that test would carry too much of the logic and if something was wrong with either class there
                    would be no way to know which class had the issues just based on that test.
                </p>
                <h5 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">
                    The Open-Closed Principle
                </h5>
                <p>
                    This principle states that objects must be open for extension but closed for modification. This
                    means that once the code is finished for an object that object is done with what it does. If it
                    works properly then it should be left alone and if anyone wants to add to the object then should
                    extend on it outside the object itself. In this calculator, all objects were created with one
                    purpose. This principle was followed because no objects in this code were modified once there
                    working code was finished. There were plenty of situations where external extensions had to be made
                    but
                    no objects were modified.

                <h5 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">
                    The Liskov Substitution Principle
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Defines the relationship between the inherited 'parent' and 'child' class. Stating that a child
                    should be substitutable for a parent class but no parents class should have a dependcy on a child
                    class. This means that a child class inherites all the methods and properties of a parent class
                    and therefore can be substituted for it. But a parent class should be able to work on its own
                    without any necessary help from a child class. This calculator follows this principle as in the
                    few inherited classes that there are. The child classes take in all necessary parts of the parent
                    class yet the parent class stays avaibale for use without a child class. The best example of this
                    in the calculator is the operations classes being children of the Calculations class. They all use
                    the conversion for tuples to list to tuples in order to get their results and therefore can be
                    substituted if necessary but the Calculation class still works without any the children.
                </p>
                <h5 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">
                    The Interface Segregation Principle
                </h5>
                <p>
                    This principle states that classes should do one and only one action. A class cannot be made to
                    perform multiple actions as it is better to separate the multiple actions into subclasses. The
                    best example of this principle is also with the Calculation class and operation subclasses. The
                    Calculation class does not do addition or subtraction it only provides a tuple list that is
                    functional for floating point numbers. It then allows the operations classes to use this function
                    in order to do their own operations. Therefore, even though classes are inheriting an action
                    they are still only using that action to do the one thing they are made to do.
                </p>
                <h5 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">
                    The Dependency Inversion Principle
                </h5>
                <p>
                    This principle states that functions can call each other. It is vital in this calculator that
                    function can call and depend on one another. The calculator would not work if dependencies did
                    not go back and forth between the classes. A great example of this is within the operations. The
                    operations need to be able to call upon themselves to perform the actions of adding, subtracting,
                    multiplying or dividing one value from another.

                    Design Patterns
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The Design Patterns are used through the Calculator. There are many common issues that were run into
                    throughout the creation of the calculator and the Design Patterns provided a solution for every single
                    problem. A main one is the Factory Method within the
                    Creational Design Patterns. This pattern designates a way to create objects but allows the classes
                    to instantiate them on their own. The calculator name its factory method according, 'create'.
