    About Page
    <p>Hi! My name is Collin Fogerty. A little about me is that I am in my second semester of a masters in Cyber
        Security
        and Privacy. I hope to graduate at the end of this spring semester and then go into the real world. I also play
        on
        the lacrosse team here at NJIT. I have played for 5 years and made some of my best friends. This class has
        already
        taught me so many hands on tools I think are really useful and I hope to learn more. Thank you!
