            <h1 class="display-4 fst-italic">Object Oriented Programming</h1>
            <p class="lead my-3"> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes
                software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a
                data field that has unique attributes and behavior. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to
                manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is
                well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.</p>

                    <li><span class="boldunder">instantiation</span> means to create an instance of an object</li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">objects</span> are instances of a class created with specifically
                        defined data
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">class</span> is a user-defined data type that acts as the blueprint for
                        individual objects, attributes and methods
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">namespaces</span> are the structures used to organize the symbolic names assigned to objects in a Python program
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">constructor</span> is a special method of a class or structure in
                        object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">fixture</span> allows you to maintain a fixed and well-known environment
                        for testing
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">type hint</span> means to provide hints to a function to only accept the
                        given data type. It is also a method by which one can force a function to accept the desired
                        data type
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">type cast</span> is a way of changing an object from one data type to
                        the next that is used to ensure a function handles the variables correctly
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">unit test</span> is a program that test classes. Each test case consists
                        of a fixed sequence of method invocations with fixed arguments that explores a particular aspect
                        of the behavior of the class under the test
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">static</span> means that the variable or method is available at the
                        class level. In other words, one doesn't need to create an instance of the class to access it
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">instance method</span> is a method that belongs to instances of a class,
                        not to the class itself
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">instance property</span> a special sort of class member, intermediate in
                        functionality between a field (or data member) and a method ora property is a member that
                        provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">static method</span> means a method is part of a class definition, but
                        is not part of the objects it creates
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">static property</span></li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">encapsulation</span> is a principle that states all important
                        information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed. The
                        implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class. Other objects
                        do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes. They are only able to call a
                        list of public functions or methods
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">inheritance</span> means that classes can reuse code from other classes.
                        Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse
                        common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">ploymorphism</span> means that objects are designed to share behaviors
                        and they can take on more than one form. The program will determine which meaning or usage is
                        necessary for each execution of that object from a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate
                        code. A child class is then created, which extends the functionality of the parent class
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">abstraction</span> means that objects only reveal internal mechanisms
                        that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. The
                        derived class can have its functionality extended
                    </li>

                            S.O.L.I.D. stands for the first 5 principles of object orientated programming:
                            Single-responsibility Principle, Open-closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle,
                            Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. Single-responsibility
                            Principle (SRP) states: A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that
                            a class should have only one job. Open-closed Principle (OCP) states: Objects or entities
                            should be open for extension but closed for modification. Liskov Substitution Principle
                            states: Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be
                            provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. Interface segregation principle
                            states: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or
                            clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Dependency inversion
                            principle states: Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that
                            the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on
                            abstractions.

                            Design Patterns are general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems within a given
                            context in software design.
                            Design patterns are already defined and provide an industry standard approach to solve a
                            recurring problem, so it saves time if we use the design pattern. Using design pattern
                            promotes re-usability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable
                            code. Since design patterns are already defined, it makes out code easy to understand and
                            debug.
                            It leads to faster development and new members of the team understand it easily.
                            Design patterns have three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Creational
                            concerns the way objects and classes were created. It Structural concerns the composition of
                            classes and objects. Behavioural characterizes the ways in which classes or objects
                            interact and distribute responsibility.
