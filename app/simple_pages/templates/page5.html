            <p class="lead my-3"> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes
                software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a
                data field that has unique attributes and behavior. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to
                manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is
                well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.
                is a computer programming model that uses objects to describe its actions. An object is a unique data
                field that takes in

                    <li><span class="boldunder">instantiation</span> means to create a copy of a class in memory
                        (instance)
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">objects</span> are instances of a class created with specifically
                        defined data
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">class</span> is a user-defined data type that holds all of
                        it own objects, attributes and methods. Created by simply say class (classname). In this
                        calculator, there is 'class Addition' that is created as such.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">namespaces</span> are the structures (files and folders) that are used
                        to properly organize program. This calculator has a folder called calculator with a file in it
                        call __init__.py
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">constructor</span> is the first method called of a class that sets up
                        data for objects
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">fixture</span> allows you to maintain a fixed and well-known environment
                        for testing
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">type hint</span> means to provide hints to a function to only accept the
                        given data type. It is also a method by which one can force a function to accept the desired
                        data type
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">type cast</span> is a way of changing an object from one data type to
                        the next that is used to ensure a function handles the variables correctly
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">unit test</span> is a program that test classes. Each test case consists
                        of a fixed sequence of method invocations with fixed arguments that explores a particular aspect
                        of the behavior of the class under the test
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">static</span> means that the variable or method is available at the
                        class level. In other words, one doesn't need to create an instance of the class to access it
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">instance method</span> is a function within a class that works on the
                        data inside itself and can only be called after an object if its class is instantiated. Example
                        in this calculator is the get_result() method that needs the calculator object to be
                        instantiated beforehand.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">instance property</span> a variable that is attached to the class that
                        can only be called after an object if its class is instantiated. that needs the calc1 object to
                        be instantiated beforehand.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">static method</span> is a function within a class that can be called
                        without instantiating an object of its class. In this calculator, add, subtract, multiple, and
                        divide are all static methods as they can be called anywhere without creating an object of their
                        respective classes. Marked as @staticmethod.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">static property</span> a variable that is attached to the class that can
                        be called without instantiating an object of its class. Almost like a global property. Example
                        in this calculator is the result property that can be called without
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">encapsulation</span> is a principle that states all important
                        information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed. The
                        implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class. Other objects
                        do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes. They are only able to call a
                        list of public functions or methods
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">inheritance</span> means that classes can reuse code from other classes.
                        An inherited class will gain the properties and methods of the class it is inheriting from. The
                        relationship can be understood just as a child inherits the features of their parent. A 'child'
                        class will inherit the methods and properties of their 'parent' class.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">ploymorphism</span> means that one should design their code so objects
                        are designated to have some of the same actions (methods or properties). This is because objects
                        needs to be able to calculate their characteristics in the same way but uniquely for each
                        object. Without this property, each object would have to check itself each and everytime it tried to
                        use a method which would not be satisfactory.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="boldunder">abstraction</span> means that objects only reveal internal mechanisms
                        that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. The
                        derived class can have its functionality extended
                    </li>

                            S.O.L.I.D. is the acronym used for the first 5 principles of object orientated programming:
                            Single-responsibility Principle, Open-closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle,
                            Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. Single-responsibility
                            Principle (SRP) states: A class should have one and only 1 job. In this calculator,
                            the only thing the Addition class does is add.
                            Open-closed Principle (OCP) states: Objects or entities
                            should be open for extension but closed for modification. Liskov Substitution Principle
                            states: Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be
                            provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. Interface segregation principle
                            states: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or
                            clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Dependency inversion
                            principle states: Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that
                            the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on
                            abstractions.

                            Design Patterns is the framework for how Object Oriented Programming should be laid out, and
                            it includes the solutions for whatever problems in the coding design may occur.
                            Design patterns are industry standard so that everyone using this language of programming
                            understands that this is the way problems are to solved and how the code is to be laid out.
                            This is so that code in any language can be shared amongst industry peers and subsequently
                            learned and understood in an easy, efficient
                            fashion.
                            There are 3 types of Design Patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Creational
                            concerns the way objects and classes were created (example: factory method 'create'). Structural
                            concerns the composition of classes and objects (example: decorator). Behavioural characterizes the ways in which
                            classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility (example: memento).
