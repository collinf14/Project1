            <p class="lead my-3"> Calculator Integration and Continuous Deployment is the practice of running a program
                fully while editing the source code. CI/CD allows for testing and experimentation as a developer is
                going through the process of a building a project. It is also used to get apps to consumers as quickly
                as possible and allow for changes based on the consumers wants and needs as it is seen fit.</p>

                <p>
                    In this calculator, there are a couple instances of the Encapsulation principle. The simplest exam
                    is in the test_calculator_result_property where there are different class (calc1, calc2) that
                    encapsulate the information that is inside them in memory. The calc1.result and calc2 classes are only  able to

                    Inheritance
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In this calculator, many of the classes need to gain objects and properties from other classes. For example the addition class cannot work without the objects and properties of the calculation class.

                    When the main branch was actually updated, this triggered a deployment to Dockerhub so that the
                    container image was also updated. This was also done through one of the workflows check as it
                    allowed for connection to Docker Hub in the source code.
