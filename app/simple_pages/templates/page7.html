            <p class="lead my-3"> The Calculator is coding in the style of Object Oriented Programming. The properties
                of OOP are the terms encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These terms define
                OOP and without these core concepts involved a project cannot be considered object oriented.
                Their interpretations within the calculator an OOP project are described below.</p>

                    Encapsulation
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In this calculator, there are a couple instances of the Encapsulation principle. The simplest exam
                    is in the test_calculator_result_property where there are different class (calc1, calc2) that
                    encapsulate the information that is inside them in memory. The calc1.result and calc2 classes are only  able to

                            calc1 = Calculator()<br>
                            calc2 = Calculator()<br>
                            calc1.result = 5<br>
                            calc2.result = 6
                            <span class="orange">assert</span> calc1.result == 5

                    Inheritance
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In this calculator, many of the classes need to gain objects and properties from other classes.
                    For example the addition class cannot work without the objects and properties of the calculation class.

                    Polymorphism
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The 'many shapes' property of OOP in this calculator means that objects in the classes of operations need to be
                    able to do some of the same things, such as get result, but each in their own unique way. Addition
                    needs to be able to add to get the result, Subtraction needs to subtract numbers to get the result, so
                    on and so forth. This get_result() method needs to be able to take many shapes when it is used in
                    the different objects of classes.

                    Abstraction
                </h5>
                <p>
                    When the main branch was actually updated, this triggered a deployment to Dockerhub so that the
                    container image was also updated. This was also done through one of the workflows check as it
                    allowed for connection to Docker Hub in the source code.
